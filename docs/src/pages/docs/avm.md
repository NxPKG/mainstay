## Install

```shell
avm install <VERSION_OR_COMMIT>
```

Install the specified version of mainstay-cli. The version argument should follow semver versioning. It is also possible to use `latest` as the version argument to install the latest version.

It's also possible to install based on a specific commit hash:

```shell
# <VERSION>-<COMMIT>
avm install 0.30.1-cfe82aa682138f7c6c58bf7a78f48f7d63e9e466

# Full commit hash
avm install cfe82aa682138f7c6c58bf7a78f48f7d63e9e466

# Short commit hash
avm install cfe82aa
```

## List

```shell
avm list
```

Lists available versions of mainstay-cli.
