There are two types of errors in mainstay programs. MainstayErrors and non-mainstay errors.
MainstayErrors can be divided into Mainstay Internal Errors that the framework returns from inside its own code or
custom errors which the user (you!) can return.

- MainstayErrors
  - Mainstay Internal Errors
  - Custom Errors
- Non-mainstay errors.

[MainstayErrors](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/error/struct.MainstayError.html) provides a range of information like the error name and number or the location in the code where the error was thrown, or the account that violated a constraint (e.g. a `mut` constraint). Once thrown inside the program, [you can access the error information](https://nxpkg.github.io/mainstay/ts/classes/MainstayError.html) in the mainstay clients like the typescript client. The typescript client also enriches the error with additional information about which program the error was thrown in and the CPI calls (which are explained [here](./cross-program-invocations) in the book) that led to the program from which the error was thrown from. [The milestone chapter](./tic-tac-toe) explores how all of this works together in practice. For now, let's look at how different errors can be returned from inside a program.

## Mainstay Internal Errors

> [Mainstay Internal Error Code Reference](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/error/enum.ErrorCode.html)

Mainstay has many different internal error codes. These are not meant to be used by users, but it's useful to study the reference to learn about the mappings between codes and their causes. They are, for example, thrown when a constraint has been violated, e.g. when an account is marked with `mut` but its `is_writable` property is `false`.

## Custom Errors

You can add errors that are unique to your program by using the `error_code` attribute.

Simply add it to an enum with a name of your choice. You can then use the variants of the enum as errors in your program. Additionally, you can add a message attribute to the individual variants. Clients will then display this error message if the error occurs. Custom Error code numbers start at the [custom error offset](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/error/constant.ERROR_CODE_OFFSET.html).

To actually throw an error use the [`err!`](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/macro.err.html) or the [`error!`](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/prelude/macro.error.html) macro. These add file and line information to the error that is then logged by mainstay.

```rust
#[program]
mod hello_mainstay {
    use super::*;
    pub fn set_data(ctx: Context<SetData>, data: MyAccount) -> Result<()> {
        if data.data >= 100 {
            return err!(MyError::DataTooLarge);
        }
        ctx.accounts.my_account.set_inner(data);
        Ok(())
    }
}


#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("MyAccount may only hold data below 100")]
    DataTooLarge
}
```

### require!

You can use the [`require`](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/macro.require.html) macro to simplify writing errors. The code above can be simplified to this (Note that the `>=` flips to `<`):

```rust
#[program]
mod hello_mainstay {
    use super::*;
    pub fn set_data(ctx: Context<SetData>, data: MyAccount) -> Result<()> {
        require!(data.data < 100, MyError::DataTooLarge);
        ctx.accounts.my_account.set_inner(data);
        Ok(())
    }
}


#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("MyAccount may only hold data below 100")]
    DataTooLarge
}
```

There are a couple of `require` macros to choose from ([search for require in the docs](https://docs.rs/mainstay-lang/latest/mainstay_lang/?search=require)). When comparing public keys, it's important to use the `keys` variants of the require statements like `require_keys_eq` instead of `require_eq` because comparing public keys with `require_eq` is very expensive.

> (Ultimately, all programs return the same Error: The [`ProgramError`](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/program_error/enum.ProgramError.html).

This Error has a field for a custom error number. This is where Mainstay puts its internal and custom error codes. However, this is just a single number and a single number is only so useful. So in addition, in the case of MainstayErrors, Mainstay logs the returned MainstayError and the Mainstay clients parse these logs to provide as much information as possible. This is not always possible. For example, there is currently no easy way to get the logs of a `processed` transaction with preflight checks turned off. In addition, non-mainstay or old mainstay programs might not log MainstayErrors. In these cases, Mainstay will fall back to checking whether the returned error number by the transaction matches an error number defined in the `IDL` or an Mainstay internal error code. If so, Mainstay will at least enrich the error with the error message. Also, if there are logs available, Mainstay will always try to parse the program error stack and return that so you know which program the error was returned from.
