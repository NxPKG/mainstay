## What is Mainstay

With Mainstay you can quickly build secure Solana programs, sometimes called 'smart contracts', because: 

 - Mainstay writes various boilerplate for you such as (de)serialization of accounts and instruction data.
 - Mainstay handles certain security checks for you, and allows you to succinctly define additional checks and keep them separate from your business logic.

Both of these aspects mean that instead of working on the tedious parts of raw Solana programs, you can spend more time working on what matters most, your product.
